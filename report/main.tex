\chapter{Introduction}
The task was to implement a simple version of the Flow Map algorithm which is used to bring arbitrary boolean functions and - networks to PCBs with limited size of lookup tables.



\chapter{BLIF Parser}
The Parser of the Espresso-project is used again and developed further; especially the functions are now stored in a graph-structure. It is still ready-to-use for the Espresso-package. The parser now also supports latches and sub-circuits in a basic way that enables it to hold this information in memory and save it back to file.

The Graph is provided via the GraphNode-interface. Each GraphNode consists of a list of input nodes (can be a special list, that allows only one element), a set of output nodes and a name. The name is not necessarily unique in one model: In the BLIF-Fileformat, the model's outputs can be manually specified. It is therefore possible to have a functional tree, which is not used by any successor component. Such unused paths should be eliminated by a good optimization but the parser sould be able to read and write even such unused paths. To store the list of used outputs, it is a goot idea to create a special OutputNode-Type. This output automatically uses the same name as its predecessor-node. Otherwise a name-string must be generated which was of no relevance for the BLIF-format. Finally it can be said, that a GraphNode is clearly specified by its node type (class) and its string name.

The graph-tree is meant to be modified by the node's inputs (predecesssors) while the outputs (successors) are readonly for most packages. The implementations of the GraphNode-interface use instances of the in-list that are self-linking, which means a command node1.in().set(0, node2); will remove node1 from the out-set of node1.in[0] and add node1 to the out-set of node2. The out-sets are initialized with special HashSets, that throw exceptions when calling modifying functions like out().add() or out().remove(). Only the self-linking-lists have write access to the out-sets.

Sub-circuits are no GraphNodes, because a GraphNode only has one output literal (which can of-curse be used by several successors, stored in the out-set). A Sub-circuit can have multiple outputs and each of them could have multiple successors. So the sub-circuit's inputs and outputs are realized as GraphNodes and the sub-circuit appears in the graph-tree like a set of general model's inputs and outputs. So it is not possible, to compose logic across model corners. A function, that inserts the sub-circuit's logic into the parent model is required therefore.

In general, the graph implementation of the BLIF-structure is kept simple and small for not overcharging other projects (like Espresso) which don't need the graph-functionalities. The graph processing functionality of models and functions is realized in inherited classes GraphModel and GraphFunction. The programmer needs to give factories for this class-types to the BLIF-parser for the FlowMap-project.



\chapter{Decomposition}
\label{decomposition}

\label{fig:decompose1}
\end{wrapfigure}
The decomposition's task is to split each function, that has more than two inputs. It is an arbitrary complex problem to decide, which tree of two-input functions is the smalles/best representation of the model. But for FlowMap, the problem is much simpler: There is never a xor-gate or something like that extracted out of a multi-input function for decomposition. The function is regarded to be a set of and-gates, which are finally connected by one or-gate. On this structure, simple gate-level decomposition is done. The result may not be the smallest or fastest possible tree of two-input functions, but the composition-algorithm will later put possibly inefficiently splitted function-parts in the same lookup-table again.

A problem can result from redundant functions. A decomposition like in \ref{fig:decompose1} can easily result from a BLIF, that describes each of the outputs in one boolean function. The composition with three inputs would result in four lookup tables, while the and-tree is redundant. When setting reUseExistingFunctions to true, the decomposition don't re-create functions with equal inputs and functionality. It can also be seen, that decomposition in a different order can create a structure, where the and-gates are non-redundant regarding the graph structure. An advanced concept of removing redundant structures was not task of this project and could be verry difficult. The reUseExistingFunctions only finds a few gates, that can be re-used.

Negated inputs are put in the and-gates' literals, but not in the or-gates. For a function, that uses a negated input directly in the or-structure like [ab + c'], a not-gate (one negated input and-gate) will be inserted at c.

\chapter{Composition}
\label{composition}
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.41\textwidth}

\caption{Composition principle}
\label{fig:compose1}
\end{wrapfigure}
The function GraphModel.composeFrunctionsFromGraph(cluster) computes the logic composition. Cluster.getStage() contains a vertex-list of all model outputs (which sould not but can be the OutputNodes or subcircuit-Links). If a vertex is linked with an OutputNode, the algorithm must branch to this OutputNode's input GraphFunction, otherwise keep the vertex' GraphNode as the composition target. If this is not a GraphFunction, it must be an input and will be returned without computing any composition. In case of a latch, the function cannot decide, weather it is an output or input. So it assumes it to be an input, and don't uses its predecessor GraphFunction to compute any composition on it.

cluster.getCluster().get(vertex) returns a list of the composition corner (the vertices, that will not be composed into the vertex, but have successors that will).

The composeSet-function starts with the list of composition corner-nodes and the composition target node and returns the composed on-set of a new function, that represents the subtree between target and corner. It can be seen, that each composition-corner vertex will be a composition-target of a previous subtree or a graph-input (Model input, subcircuit output or latch).

The function of a certain GraphNode can have negated inputs. According to the decomposition-phase (\ref{decomposition}), this negated inputs should only occur immediately behind the graph inputs. But principally there could be a two-input-function in the subtree, having a negated input of an other GraphFunction. Therefore, the composition algorithm is able to compute the complementation of such an input-set. The complementation algorithm was implemented as an addition to the Espresso-project.

The composeVertex-function starts with one composition-target vertex, finds the corner and recursively processes the compositions of the corner's vertices before computing the composition of the given vertex. All successor-nodes of the composition-target, that are no functions, are linked to the new, composed function.

When composeFrunctionsFromGraph finishes, there is still the original two-input-graph in the model and the new composed one in addition. The two-input-graph should endup with functions, that have no successor nodes. Such dead functions can be removed by calling cleanFunctions(). This function is called recursively until no more dead functions are found. After this, the two-input-tree should be completely removed from the model.



\chapter{Conclusion}
For testing, a 5-input-function is composed to 5-input-lookup-tables. This means, the result will contain only one function that must be equal to the original function except of the order of cubes and inputs. This is the case.

It is probable, that latches will cause problems as described in \ref{composition}.
